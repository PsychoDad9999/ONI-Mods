# Mods for Oxygen Not Included

## Installation

The easiest way to install ONI mods is using the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/?appid=457140). If you prefer to not use the steam workshop a local copy of my mods can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/PsychoDad9999/ONI-Mods/releases/tag/ModsLatest).

Extract the zip archive and place the mods in the following folder:

* Windows  `C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\Klei\Oxygen Not Included\mods\Local`
* Mac OS   `/Users/[USERNAME]/Library/Application Support/unity.Klei.Oxygen Not Included/mods/Local`
* Linux    `~/.config/unity3d/Klei/Oxygen Not Included/mods/Local`

__Do not use the Steam version and the local version of the same mod simultaneously.__
